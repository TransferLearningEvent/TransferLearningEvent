Hi, I'm Jules Salzinger and I'm the founder of the Transfer Learning Event. The event embodies my commitment for the field of Deep Learning, and comprises of :
- meetups : find our previous talks here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy-JlJQ5DN_nFD4AWORq0-Q/videos
- competitions (see below) with a new one coming up soon !

I also give frequent talks and presentations to help others learn about Deep Learning. Whether you are an expert, a beginner, or just a curious person with no technical background, I'm always up for a discussion ;)  
Here are the talks I've given in the past four years :

### Organized competitions :
- Ceteris Paribus Face Challenge :  https://transfer-learning.org/competition.html (launch video : https://youtu.be/X7KHU0ZnmdM)
  around 2000 euros of prize, around 100 registered participants to contribute to the field of ethics in computer vision
- Coming soon ;)

### Private teaching :
- 50h of paid private teaching
- ~300h of volunteer consultant work for associations
